<h1>WEBSITE - ACIELOUVERT</h1>
<p>This website is a model for a project of transition from WIX to PHP. The original website is avaible at this link: https://www.acielouvert.ipsa.fr</p>
<p><b>BECAREFULL WHEN YOU READ THIS!</b></p>
<p>This website has been intentionally coded in a procedural way and not in object way. The goal of this was to keep it as easy understable as possible for someone who have nerver programme before. It is also may be not perfect in term of optimisation but it work as it should for a model. It is also important to consider that the graphical part of this website wasn't the purpose of the project because I had not enough time for it.</p>
