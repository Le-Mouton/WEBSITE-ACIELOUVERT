<h1>WEBSITE - ACIELOUVERT</h1>
<p>This website is a model for a project of transition from WIX to PHP. The original website is available at this link: https://www.acielouvert.ipsa.fr</p>

<p><b><u>BE CAREFUL WHEN YOU READ THIS!</u></b></p>
<p>This website has been intentionally coded in a procedural way and not in object way. The goal of this was to keep it as easy understandable as possible for someone who have never program before. It is also may be not perfect in terms of optimization, but it works as it should for a model. It is also important to consider that the graphical part of this website wasn't the purpose of the project because I had not enough time for it.</p>
